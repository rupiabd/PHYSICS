LOFA Analysis of Research Reactors
Overview
This study investigates the impact of an unprotected Loss-of-Flow Accident (LOFA) on reactor safety for two different research reactors. The analysis is performed using the EUREKA-2/RR code, which couples point kinetics, neutronics, and thermal hydraulics. The goal is to ensure reactor safety by evaluating key parameters such as fuel cladding temperature and bulk coolant temperature under both protected and unprotected LOFA conditions.

Objectives
Assess reactor safety by analyzing LOFAs for two reference research reactors.
Investigate the impact of unprotected LOFAs on key safety parameters.
Determine if the reactors remain within design safety limits during LOFAs.
Research Reactors
Rod-Type Reactor:
Cylindrical flow channel.
Plate-Type Reactor:
Rectangular flow channels.
Methodology
Simulation Tool: EUREKA-2/RR code.
Parameters Evaluated: Fuel cladding temperature, bulk coolant temperature.
Conditions:
Protected LOFA: Simulation includes protective measures.
Unprotected LOFA: Simulation without protective measures.
Key Findings
Protected LOFA:
Both reactors maintained safety parameters within design limits.
No nucleate boiling occurred in the bulk coolant.
Unprotected LOFA:
TRIGA reactor: Safe from the viewpoint of nucleate boiling not occurring in the bulk coolant.
Both reactors: Unsafe due to maximum cladding temperatures exceeding the melting point.
Conclusion
Under protected conditions, both reactors are sufficiently safe during a LOFA. However, in the case of an unprotected LOFA, while the TRIGA reactor avoids nucleate boiling in the bulk coolant, both reactors face safety risks as the cladding temperatures exceed safe limits.
